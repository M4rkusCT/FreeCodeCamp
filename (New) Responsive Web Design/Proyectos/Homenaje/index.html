      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>In 1976, at the age of 10, Miura created his first manga titled Miuranger for his classmates, and appeared in some of his schoolâ€™s publications. As time progressed, Miuranger ended up finishing at around 40 volumes. After this Miura began work on Ken e No Michi (The Way Of The Sword) - his first work drawn using Indian ink. In 1979 while still in Middle School, Miura began using rasters for his work, and trained himself to use professional drawing methods.</li>
        <li>In 1982, he enrolled in an artistic curriculum in high school, where together with his friends they had their work published in school booklets, as well as having his first dojinshi published in a fan-produced magazine.</li>
        <li>In 1985, Miura was accepted onto an art course at Niho Daigaku University. He started two more works during this time: Futatabi and Noa - which may have been the work he showed to gain entry to the University in the first place. Futatabi and Noa were also submitted to the Shonen magazine, the magazine awarding Miura a prize for the best new author for Futatabi, and they actually published Noa in their magazine toward the end of that year. However the publications were short lived; Miura had a difference of opinion with one of the editors, and no further work was published.</li>
